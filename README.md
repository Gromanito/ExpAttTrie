# ExpAttTrie (Attribute Exploration Web Application)

## Description
This project is a web application implementing the Attribute Exploration algorithm.

It was developed during my final-year internship at LIRMM (Laboratoire d'Informatique, de Robotique et de Microélectronique de Montpellier).

## My role
I was responsible for:
- developing the graphical user interface
- implementing the algorithm

Additionally, I extended the algorithm to support:
- handling multidimensional data
- user preferences
- skipping questions

The goal was to provide a user-friendly interface to interact with the algorithm directly in the browser.


## Technologies used

- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
